Moving to a New Home: Goodbye Google Sites!

After spending time on Google Sites, I've decided to make the move to a custom website using GitHub and Vercel! (new link is C.J Philip - Writer & Creator) This new site gives me much more control over design, functionality, and how I present my content.



Why Move?

Google Sites was a great starting point, but I wanted:

- Better design flexibility

- More control over layout and features

- A professional, custom look

- Faster loading times



What's Staying the Same?

Don't worry - all my content is still here! The blogs, stories, and YouTube videos all update automatically. Nothing's lost, just presented better.
